# Authentication System: Face Recognition & Blockchain

## Overview
This project combines facial recognition technology and blockchain verification to create a highly secure document authentication system. It ensures the integrity and authenticity of user data by leveraging decentralized ledger technology.

## Technologies
- Java (Backend development)
- Ethereum Blockchain (Smart contracts)
- Hibernate ORM (Database interaction)
- MySQL (Relational database)

## Features
- Facial recognition for identity verification
- Blockchain-based record storage for tamper-proof documentation
- Integration of smart contracts
- Secure user authentication process

## How to Run
1. Set up a local MySQL database and Ethereum development environment (e.g., Ganache).
2. Compile and deploy smart contracts.
3. Build and run the Java application.
4. Interact with the application to perform authentication and verification.
